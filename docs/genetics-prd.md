## 1. Overview & Objectives

### 1.1 Product Overview

The Natural Language Query Interface is a core feature of our genetic data AI tool that empowers users—such as researchers, clinicians, and bioinformaticians—to interact with complex genomic information using everyday language. By leveraging advanced natural language processing (NLP) and integrated data retrieval from genomic repositories and research literature, the platform simplifies data access and accelerates insights.

### 1.2 Objectives

- **Simplify Querying:** Enable users to ask questions in plain language (e.g., “What is the impact of variant X in gene Y?”) without requiring familiarity with complex query languages.
- **Accurate Data Retrieval:** Extract and interpret key genetic entities (genes, variants, etc.) to return context-aware, accurate, and relevant responses.
- **Dynamic Clarification:** Automatically detect ambiguous or multi-interpretative queries and engage users with follow-up clarification dialogues (e.g., “Did you mean gene A or gene B?”) to refine the search.
- **Enhanced User Experience:** Support multi-turn conversations and iterative query refinements, ensuring that the interaction feels natural and responsive.

## 2. Target Users

- **Researchers:** Looking for quick access to genomic data and literature for hypothesis testing or exploratory research.
- **Clinicians:** Seeking relevant genetic information to aid in clinical decision-making.
- **Bioinformaticians & Geneticists:** Requiring precise data extraction and analysis of genetic variants and associated research.

## 3. User Stories & Use Cases

### 3.1 User Stories

- **Conversational Search:**
  - _As a researcher,_ I want to ask complex genomic questions in plain language so that I can obtain detailed insights without learning specialized query languages.
  - _As a clinician,_ I need to quickly determine the clinical significance of a specific genetic variant by simply typing my question, enabling rapid decision-making.
- **Clarification Dialogues:**
  - _As a user,_ I want the system to clarify ambiguous queries by offering options so that I can ensure I’m retrieving the exact information I need.
  - _As a geneticist,_ I want the system to confirm which gene or variant I am referring to when my query could be interpreted in multiple ways.

### 3.2 Use Cases

- **Use Case 1: Conversational Query Execution**
  - **Scenario:** A user enters the query “What is the impact of variant X in gene Y?”
  - **Flow:**
    1. The user submits the query via the text interface.
    2. The NLP engine extracts “variant X” and “gene Y” from the input.
    3. The system queries integrated genomic databases and literature repositories.
    4. A consolidated, context-aware answer is returned to the user.
- **Use Case 2: Clarification Dialogue for Ambiguous Queries**
  - **Scenario:** A user enters the query “Show me data on the BRCA mutation.”
  - **Flow:**
    1. The system identifies that “BRCA mutation” may refer to multiple variants (e.g., BRCA1, BRCA2).
    2. A follow-up clarification dialogue is initiated: “Did you mean BRCA1 mutation or BRCA2 mutation?”
    3. The user selects the appropriate option.
    4. The system refines the query and returns the relevant data.

## 11. Example Prompts & Expected Outputs

### Example 1: Straightforward Query

- **Prompt:**  
  _"What is the clinical significance of the BRCA1 185delAG mutation?"_
- **Expected Output:**
  > **Response:**  
  > "The BRCA1 185delAG mutation is a well-documented pathogenic variant that significantly increases the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. Current literature and genomic databases (e.g., ClinVar, Ensembl) indicate that carriers of this mutation should consider enhanced screening and risk-reducing strategies. Key references include studies published in reputable journals such as _The New England Journal of Medicine_ and _Cancer Research_. Would you like more detailed study summaries or clinical guidelines?"

### Example 2: Ambiguous Query Requiring Clarification

- **Prompt:**  
  _"Show me data on the BRCA mutation."_
- **Expected Output (Initial Clarification):**

  > **Clarification Prompt:**  
  > "The term 'BRCA mutation' could refer to mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2. Did you mean:
  >
  > 1. BRCA1 mutation
  > 2. BRCA2 mutation?"
  >
  > _(User selects option 2: BRCA2 mutation)_

- **Expected Output (After User Clarification):**
  > **Response:**  
  > "BRCA2 mutations are associated with an increased risk for breast, ovarian, and other cancers. Data from genomic repositories and recent research studies (sourced from PubMed and ClinVar) indicate that specific variants, such as the BRCA2 6174delT mutation, are clinically significant. Would you like to see a detailed summary of recent research findings or clinical recommendations for BRCA2 mutation carriers?"

### Example 3: Multi-Turn Dialogue for Complex Queries

- **Prompt:**  
  _"How does the MTHFR mutation affect folate metabolism, and what are the clinical recommendations?"_
- **Expected Output (Initial Response):**

  > **Response:**  
  > "The MTHFR mutation—especially the C677T variant—leads to reduced enzyme activity, resulting in impaired folate metabolism and elevated homocysteine levels. This biochemical change is linked with increased cardiovascular risk and other health issues. Current clinical recommendations often include folate supplementation and regular monitoring of homocysteine levels. Would you like additional details on the biochemical pathways involved or an overview of the latest clinical trial data?"

- **Follow-Up (If User Requests More Detail):**
  > **Extended Response:**  
  > "Here is a detailed breakdown of the biochemical pathway: [Diagram or bullet-point summary]. Recent clinical trials, such as those published in _The Journal of Nutrition_ and _Circulation_, support the use of folate supplementation to mitigate these effects. Please specify if you need the full study details or a summary of key findings."
